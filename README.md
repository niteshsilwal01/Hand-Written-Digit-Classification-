# Hand-Written-Digit-Classification-
This is a primary attempt towards classification of hand written digit images using the Artificial Neural Network algorithm.

Data set is taken from Keras library under Tensorflow
### How to access the data set??
Well, you can have the  standard method for importing the dataset:

(X_train,y_train),(X_test,y_test)= keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
